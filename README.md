# Continuum: User-Owned Identity for the AI Era

**An open specification for cross-platform AI memory that users actually own.**

## What This Is

This is a complete technical and business specification for **Continuum** - a system that gives users persistent identity across every AI platform they use (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) without surrendering privacy or control.

I'm **not building this**. I'm sharing it publicly in hopes that someone will.

If you build this, I'll be your first user.

## What's Included

- **Full whitepaper** (47 pages): Technical architecture, business model, go-to-market strategy
- **User scenarios**: Real-world use cases with before/after examples
- **Competitive analysis**: How this differs from existing solutions
- **Privacy-first design**: Three modes (ephemeral, curated, automatic)
- **Implementation roadmap**: Phase 1-4 rollout plan

## Core Concept

**The Problem:**
You explain your project to ChatGPT. Switch to Claude. Have to re-explain everything. Waste 10-20 minutes per day on context repetition.

**The Solution:**
A browser extension that gives every AI platform access to your project context - but only what you approve, fully encrypted, completely under your control.

**Example:**
```
You (to ChatGPT): "I'm building a multi-tenant SaaS app..."
[Continuum captures context]

Later (to Claude): "Optimize my database queries"
Claude: "Right, for your multi-tenant SaaS app. Here's how..."
```

No re-explanation. Seamless continuity.

## Key Innovations

1. **User Sovereignty**: You own your encrypted data (zero-knowledge architecture)
2. **Cross-Platform**: Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, any future AI
3. **Three Privacy Modes**: Session (ephemeral), Curated (you approve), Archive (automatic)
4. **Hierarchical Compression**: Designed for 10+ years of use without bloat
5. **Open Protocol**: Not platform lock-in, but interoperable infrastructure

## Why I'm Sharing This

I spent 3 months designing this system. I believe it needs to exist. I'm not technical enough to build it myself.

So I'm open-sourcing the entire specification. Consider it yours.

## License

This work is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). 

**TL;DR:** Use this however you want. Build it, sell it, modify it. Just keep the license notice.

If you build this and it becomes valuable, crediting me would be appreciated but is not required.

- **Twitter/X:** [@your handle] (optional)

I'm happy to advise on product/strategy if you're serious about building.

## If You Build This

Please let me know! I want to:
1. Be your first user
2. Help spread the word
3. Provide feedback

This is the AI memory system I wish existed. Make it real.
